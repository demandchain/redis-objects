== 0.4.0 [Final] (11 August 2010)

* Full support for redis hashes via new Redis::Hash class [Julio Capote, Nate Wiger]

* Now dependent on redis-rb client 2.0.4 or later.  Should still be backwards compatible with redis-server 1.x

* Fixes to sets and sorted sets to bring them up to speed with redis-rb 2.0 from tomstuart [Tom Stuart]

* Incompatible change: Update list[x,y] and sorted_set[x,y] to work consistently with Ruby in all cases [Tom Stuart]

* Refactoring to make constructors common across all object types from dbalatero [David Balatero]

* Renamed :withscores option to :with_scores for consistency with redis-rb 2.0, but kept backwards compat [Tom Stuart, Nate Wiger]

== 0.3.2 [Final] (21 July 2010)

* New "maxlength" option to Redis::List can create length-limited lists (eg, like a ring buffer) from dbalatero [David Balatero]

== 0.3.1 [Final] (1 June 2010)

* Integrated fixes for sorted_set deletions from capotej [Julio Capote]

== 0.3.0 [Final] (14 April 2010)

* Due to Ruby 1.9 bugs and performance considerations, marshaling of data types is now OFF by default.  You must say :marshal => true for any objects that you want serialization enabled on. [Nate Wiger]

* Sorted Set class changed slightly due to feedback. You can now get an individual element back via @set['item'] since it acts like a Hash.
